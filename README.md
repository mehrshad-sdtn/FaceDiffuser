Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion for photorealistic human face synthesis with LoRA

---

## Overview
This project fine-tunes a pretrained diffusion modelâ€”**Stable Diffusion**â€”to specialize in generating **high-fidelity human faces**. While Stable Diffusion is a powerful general-purpose model, its facial outputs often suffer from unrealistic structure, poor detail, and identity artifacts.

By using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** and a subset of high-quality face images, we significantly enhance the model's ability to generate photorealistic and anatomically plausible faces.

## Technology Stack

- **PyTorch** â€“ Core deep learning framework
- **Stable Diffusion v1.5** â€“ Pretrained text-to-image base model
- **LoRA** â€“ Lightweight fine-tuning approach with low memory overhead
- **FFHQ Dataset** â€“ 7,000 high-resolution face images used for training

> ðŸ“Œ *Note: Only a subset of 7,000 images from FFHQ was used. We expect further improvements with larger datasets and longer training schedules.*

## Results

**Comparison (FID â†“ is better):**

| Comparison            | FID Score |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Real vs. Base         | 150.7     |
| Real vs. Fine-tuned   | 108.5     |
| Base vs. Fine-tuned   | 83.6      |

The fine-tuned model shows noticeable improvements in facial structure, sharpness, and coherence.

-  Photographic restoration and upscaling  
-  Virtual try-on (makeup, glasses, hairstyles)  
-  Data augmentation for facial recognition or landmark detection  
-  Concept art and visual storytelling  
-  NPC generation in interactive fiction and virtual worlds
-  3D face generation


## Report and Downstream 3D generation
We have also used [Wonder3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15008) which is an image to 3D model to generate 3D meshes from our model's output and achieved pretty interesting results. You can read the report [here]().
